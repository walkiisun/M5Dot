## Summary
###This project aimed to build a cost-effective, reliable, and modular product that can collect data, write it to a database and visualize it. This project was built upon the Sensoweb Labatory's current NewDot product at The University of Georgia. The NewDot Product uses a Raspberry Pi computer and a seismic sensor. This project set out to develop a complementary project by integrating a more cost-effective microcontroller and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor.
